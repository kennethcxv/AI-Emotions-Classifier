# Emotion Detecting AI
## Overview

Emotion Detecting AI is a sophisticated emotion classification system, expertly crafted using the latest in deep learning and computer vision technologies. Developed between January and March 2023, this innovative project excels in accurately analyzing facial expressions, thereby significantly enhancing user experiences across various sectors.

## Features
- **Advanced Emotion Recognition:** Employs cutting-edge deep learning models for accurate detection and analysis of emotions.
- **Diverse Industry Applications:** Tailored for impactful use in customer service, healthcare, and entertainment sectors.
- **Precision Analysis:** Processes data from 43 facial muscles for nuanced emotion detection.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Offers immediate emotion interpretation for dynamic interactions.

## Technology Stack
- **Python:** Backend development and machine learning model implementation.
- **JavaScript & React:** Front-end development for an interactive, user-friendly interface.
- **Deep Learning Libraries:** Such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development and training.

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm or yarn
- React

### Installation
Clone the repository
  ```git clone https://github.com/kennethcxv/AI-Emotions-Classifier.git```
  
Install Python dependencies
  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Install JavaScript dependencies
  ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```

### Usage
Launch the backend server:
  ```python server.py```

Start the React application:
  ```npm start```
  
## How It Works
- The system captures facial expressions via camera or video.
- The backend processes facial muscle data and feeds it into the deep learning model.
- The model classifies the emotion and relays the results to the front-end.
- Real-time emotion data is displayed on the React-based interface.
